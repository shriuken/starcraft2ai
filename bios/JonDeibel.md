## About me
While I enjoy building applications on any platform, my latest passion has revolved around Machine Learning. Specifically creating intelligent systems that can do complicated tasks. The two big areas that I think are really fascinating are self driving cars and game AI (like alpha-go).

## Co-op Work experience

### Intuit | 2015 - 2017

Here I started out working on java build systems, and eventually transitioned to working on front-end code. I worked on building and architecting a scalable rules driven payroll system from the ground up. This work was to figure out how to represent and use compliance rules for payroll that could easily be transferred to other countries. From there I then worked on moving tech stacks from dojo/backbone to react/relay/graphql.

### Projects sought

I really want to learn more and deep dive on creating an intelligent learning system that is capable of completing a complicated task. Specifically I would love to create a game AI.
