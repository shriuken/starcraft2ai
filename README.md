## Abstract

There have been many recent advances in game-playing AIs, such as the [Dota2 AI](https://blog.openai.com/dota-2/) and [AlphaGo](https://deepmind.com/research/alphago/). With this project, we aim to explore the use of conventional and cutting edge ML techniques to create a self-learning [Starcraft II (SC2)](https://www.starcraft2.com/en-us/) AI agent that can play against Blizzard AI.

## Project Description

Inspired by recent advances in game-playing AI, we are attempting to address a similarly themed, albeit different problem - creating an SC2 AI agent that operates at human APM (actions per minute), up to ~300apm. Current SC2 AI agents abuse the fact that agents are able to take an inhuman number of actions extraordinarily quickly (such as 5000apm). Our goal is to restrict APM down to ~300apm in order to model our AI off of human capabilities and to more-effectively learn  decisions. With a hard-limit of ~300apm, any given action taken will have more importance than if the bot had a higher limit, such as ~5000apm. 

We are scoping our project in the following manner:
  * the agent will play as [Terran](http://us.battle.net/sc2/en/game/race/terran/) 
  * against a (yet-to-be-determined) stock Blizzard AI controlled target race
  * on a (yet-to-be-determined) 1v1 ladder map.
