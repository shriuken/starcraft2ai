 |  Milestone / Deliverable | Comments  | Estimated Target Date |
 |  ----------------------- | --------  | --------------------- |
 |  Build Bot for a Race    | Develop a proof of concept bot without (inherently) using machine learning in order to understand how the SC2 AI API works so we can use it in conjunction with developing an ML based bot. | Nov 31, 2017 |
 |  Architect RL Model      | Create the skeleton of our RL model for how we are going to train the bot. This way we can feed in data from our gameplay data (for training) and live game state/data (playing). Proof of concept preferred, but not required.   |   Nov 31, 2017  |
 |  GameState Data Parser   | Create the parse machine to read in replay data to feed to the bot / RL model.  | Dec 31, 2017  |
 |  Decision Mapper         | Map the RL model's output to actionable commands within the SC2 bot. |  Dec 31, 2017  |  
 |  Decision Engine         | Complete the RL model and train a bot to play the game. | Jan 31, 2017  |
 |  Presentation Poster     | Create the poster describing details, stack used, etc for use in the expo fair. | Mar 31, 2017  |
